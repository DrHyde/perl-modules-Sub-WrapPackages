Ths module makes it easy to surround large numbers of subroutines and
methods with pre- and post-execution code.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
